<p>These Terms are heavily insipired by and built on the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic">work</a> of the folks at <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a>.</p>
<p>As stated in the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic">legalmattic</a> project&#39;s README.md, they have been open sourcing the legalese of Wordpress.com services since 2014. In their words: &quot;We&#39;d like our legal documents to embody our vision of the spirit of the web - open and accessible.&quot;</p>
<p>We, at Habemus, share that same vision and are deeply grateful for their work, both for the open source Blogging Platform Wordpress and specifically for the legalmattic project. Thanks!</p>
