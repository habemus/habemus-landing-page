<h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Habemus we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don&#39;t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can&#39;t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
<li>We don&#39;t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
<li>We don&#39;t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
<li>In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what&#39;s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: (Note, we&#39;ve decided to make this privacy policy available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Sharealike</a> license, which means you&#39;re more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use, just make sure to replace references to us with ones to you, and if you want we&#39;d appreciate a link to Automattic.com somewhere on your site. We spent a lot of money and time on the below, and other people shouldn&#39;t need to do the same.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our <a href="mailto:hello@habem.us">support team</a>.</p>
<h3 id="website-visitors">Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Habemus collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Habemus&#39;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Habemus&#39;s visitors use its website. From time to time, Habemus may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Habemus also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Habemus only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
<h3 id="gathering-of-personally-identifying-information">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to Habemus’s websites choose to interact with Habemus in ways that require Habemus to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Habemus gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an Habemus Developer account to provide a username and valid email address. Those who engage in transactions with Habemus – by purchasing a Habemus Business Hosting service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Habemus collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Habemus. Habemus does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h3 id="aggregated-statistics">Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Habemus may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Habemus may monitor the most popular websites on the Habemus.website site. Habemus may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Habemus does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h3 id="protection-of-certain-personally-identifying-information">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Habemus discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Habemus&#39; behalf or to provide services available at Habemus&#39; websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Habemus&#39; websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Habemus will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Habemus discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Habemus believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Habemus, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Habemus website and have supplied your email address, Habemus may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Habemus and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Habemus takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h3 id="business-transfers">Business Transfers</h3>
<p>If Habemus, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Habemus goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Habemus may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-policy-changes">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Habemus may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Habemus&#39; sole discretion. Habemus encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a Habemus.io account, you should also check your website&#39;s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>

<h4 id="attribution-">Attribution:</h4>
<p>These Terms are heavily insipired by and built on the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic">work</a> of the folks at <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a>.</p>
<p>As stated in the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic">legalmattic</a> project&#39;s README.md, they have been open sourcing the legalese of Wordpress.com services since 2014. In their words: &quot;We&#39;d like our legal documents to embody our vision of the spirit of the web - open and accessible.&quot;</p>
<p>We, at Habemus, share that same vision and are deeply grateful for their work, both for the open source Blogging Platform Wordpress and specifically for the legalmattic project. Thanks!</p>
